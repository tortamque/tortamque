## üåø About me:<br>
Hey! üëã <br>
My name is Vladyslav, and I am from Ukraine.<br><br>
I'm a detail-oriented software engineering student with a comprehensive understanding of the Dart and Flutter framework. I am passionate about creating high-quality applications. I have experience working with APIs, algorithms, and data structures. Throughout my journey, I have worked on various projects involving Dart, Flutter, Kotlin, Python (including backend development and Telegram bots), SQL (Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL), C++, C#, Figma, and many others.<br><br>
Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in the Kotlin programming language. My goal is to become an Android developer in the near future. To achieve this, I am diving into Jetpack Compose, Jetpack Multiplatform, and further enhancing my Flutter coding skills. Additionally, I am eager to deepen my understanding of application architecture to create robust and scalable solutions.<br><br>
I'm always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to exciting projects. Feel free to message me if you have any questions :D
